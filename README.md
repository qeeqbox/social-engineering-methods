### Principles

*   Authority: claiming a person in a leadership role (This one is common).  
*   Intimidation: claiming if an action is not taken, it will be escalated to a supervisor or a director.  
*   Consensus: claiming an action is normal and others are doing that action.  
*   Scarcity: claiming there is a limited quantity.  
*   Familiarity, introducing something that's the target already familiar with.  
*   Urgency, claiming an action is needed now; otherwise, it won't work.
